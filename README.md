### What is Opeity-Cef?

Opeity-Cef is a lightweight simple web browser based on Chromium Embedded Framework (CefSharp). Its purpose is to 
be a modern browser in situations where a full featured browser is not feasable such as under low memory conditions.

### Opeity vs Opeity-Cef

Opeity was based off the Awesomium port of Webkit as opposed to Opeity-Cef which is based on the Chromium Embedded Framework 
(CefSharp). CefSharp is much more up to date, faster, and lighter weight than Awesomium. This makes Opeity-Cef much 
faster and lighter than Opeity.

Opeity-Cef is being developed as its own independent project to superceed Opeity therefore not all features will 
be implemented across both projects.

### Building Opeity-Cef

Opeity-Cef is built with Visual Studio 2017 on Windows 10. Nuget Package Restore is enabled to make things easier 
for other developers. Please feel free to contribute to Opeity via Github.
